# Hey ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m @wmandai â€“ a curious programmer, tech enthusiast and an avid tinkerer of all things digital! If it beeps, clicks, compiles or breaks, iâ€™m probably messing with it. ðŸ˜…

## ðŸ”­ Currently Playing With...
- `/dev/craftdune & /dev/rentlipa` â€“ my latest playground
- [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine), [@Go](https://go.dev), [Tauri](https://tauri.app), IoT, Distributed Systems and a sprinkle of AI for good measure ðŸ¤–

## ðŸŒ± Growing my skill tree with...
- Microservices, Kubernetes sorcery and the art of event-driven everything
- That one-off side project i swore i'd finish last month...

## ðŸ’¬ My Weaponry (Skills)
- **Next.js** (Vercel) & **Node.js/[Nest.JS](https://nestjs.com)** â€“ for the front and back of all things web
- **AWS, [Microservices](https://microservices.io), gRPC, APIs** â€“ cloud wizardry, communication magic, and making things talk 
- **CI/CD Pipelines, Serverless, PostgreSQL, [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io), MySQL** â€“ smooth deployments, less downtime, and databases for days
- **Kafka, Crypto, [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)** â€“ from event streams to stylish UIs and (possibly) decentralized dreams
